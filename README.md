DropinJS
========

Just drop in the damn files into browser and run it.

Motive
------

The web front end is now conquered by future hi-techs. Developers will be considered *not modern* if not
using babel to do transpiling. Awesome stuff such as React would be hard to use without transpiling.

Transpiling is slow and I'm wasting lots of time each time I need to start or restart webpack. I'm also
totally tired with the configuring every time I decieded that I want to use React.

But look, JavaScript ES6 is now supported natively in Chrome which is the only browser I'd care when doing
some personal stuff. We've got the cool kids in town, living with generators, arrow functions and template
strings are amazing already.

So now, I'm creating this library/toolset to make it even better to work directly in browser.
